# Yee-Interpretor-1.1.0
The interpreter for my programming language Yee. Documentation will be found here when I make it. The executable for the interpreter is in the bin folder, and for it to work you must have the entire bin folder unchanged. Make sure, when running a file, to inout the entire path to the file!
